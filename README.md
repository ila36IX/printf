# Printf Project

## Project Overview:
Welcome to our Custom Printf project!
Our mission here is to build a custom version of the printf function in C. Why? Well, it's not just about replicating what the standard printf does. Instead, it's about delving deeper into the fundamentals of the language, descavering its low-level nature, and enhancing our interaction with it. After all, C is a language known for its low-level capabilities.

## What's the Plan?
We're diving deep into the world of C programming to reimagine printf in our own unique way. We'll handle all those format specifiers you're familiar with, like %d, %s, %c, %f, %x, and more.
